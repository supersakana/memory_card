# Memory Card

A simple game to test your memory

## About

This is based on The Odin Project [Memory Card](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-memory-card). My goal was to learn about [Vue Lifecycle Hooks](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/lifecycle.html) to shuffle the game card components before they are mounted. It's a simple use of the `mounted` method but I can see how hooking into different parts of a component's lifecycle can be useful for specific cases. Overall, this was a quick, easy, and fun vue project. Styled and responsive with Tailwind CSS.

UPDATE: I added state management using [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/). This was a great learning experience and I really enjoy the simplicity of this tool. This is a small project but I can see how this can be very useful for medium/large projects.
